Currently a post-doc in Signal Processing Laboratory 5 (LTS5), EPFL, I am working on inverse problem for radio interferometry with Prof. Jean-Philippe Thiran and Prof. Yves Wiaux. Modern radio interferometers, such as Square Kilometer Array (SKA), will acquire unprecedented amount of data, which is of paramount importance to research sophisticated imaging algorithms and efficient data processing methods, requiring interdisciplinary research in the field of physics, applied mathematics and data science. In this context, my research focuses on signal and image processing, inverse problem, compressed sensing, machine learning and optimization.

Prior to joining the LTS5 Lab, I received a B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Xidian University, Xi’an, China, in 2011, a M.Eng. (Diplôme d’Ingénieur) degree and a M.Res. degree in image processing from IMT Atlantique (ex Télécom Bretagne), Brest, France, in 2014, and a Ph.D. degree from Universié Paris-Sud, Orsay, France in 2017.
