## Abstract
The next-generation radio telescopes such as LOFAR and SKA will give access to high
time-resolution and high instantaneous sensitivity that can be exploited to study slow and fast
transients over the whole radio window. The search for radio transients in large datasets also
represents a new signal-processing challenge requiring efficient and robust signal reconstruction
algorithms. Using sparse representations and the general ‘compressed sensing’ framework, we
developed a 2D–1D algorithm based on the primal-dual splitting method. We have performed
our sparse 2D–1D reconstruction on three-dimensional data sets containing either simulated or
real radio transients, at various levels of SNR and integration times. This report presents a
summary of the current level of performance of our method.
